2. ```pip install pandas```\
```pip install jupyterlab```\
```pip install notebook```\
``` sudo dnf install sqlite3```\
```pip install sqlite3```
3. Check all the paths in the scripts and change them while running them. Sorry.
4. Be sure that you have everything installed, because I might have forgotten something :)
5. Create a ClientDB folder in the main directory and a Clients.db file inside it.
6. Open database_scripts_py folder and run the dbpy.ipynb script
7. Check if the tables are created and the data is inserted.
8. You can look in the "back" directory, where is the app.js file and you'll get how to work with the current state of the API

## How to use the API
localhost:3000/client-data/<your client id>/quarter/<Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4>
