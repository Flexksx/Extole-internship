## Setup
1. Clone the repo and put the metricscontributionlalala.csv in the main directory\
You can also put the students_data.csv\
2. The metricscontribution.csv has data by weeks, whereas students_data.csv goes by days\
Respectively, run the statistics or the statistics_per_days jupyter notebook\
3. Then you'll get the clients.json or clients_per_day.json\
Then you... Work in progress
