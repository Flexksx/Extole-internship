#TO DO
How much does a certain source effect the growth or decline of a client CR

1) growth or decrease = derivative of CR
2) function of CR = interpolation of total cr over time
3) CR depends on - source, time
4) ? find what a source depends on
5) define a function / create a model that represents the CR by giving sources, cr of sources and a time axis
f(t, sources[], cr_sources[]) = cr
6) if interpolation of cr gives a polynomial function, then for each client you can find the derivative and evaluate how much
does a certain source effect the growth or decline of a client CR
